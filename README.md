> Terraform boilerplate is a repository aiming to help DevOps to deploy infrastructure on AWS

## Terraform

This project is using terraform to deploy infrastructure, you can download it here: https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli

## Usage

The project is aimed to be used with `terraform workspace` which is why there is the `envs` directory. Feel free to create new files in this folder to overwrite default variables defined in [tf/2-variables.tf](./tf/2-variables.tf). 



[envs/qa.tfvars](./envs/qa.tfvars) is use in our CI/CD pipeline to make sure the code we want to merge can be deployed.



### Deploy

```sh
$ cd ./tf
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan -var-file ../envs/qa.tfvars
$ terraform apply -var-file ../envs/qa.tfvars
```



### Destroy

```sh
$ terraform destroy -var-file ../envs/qa.tfvars
```

## Testing

You can find in the [.github/workflows](./.github/workflows) folder different QA that you can run to test with Github:
- [terraform.yml](./.github/workflows/terraform.yml): automatically running on master and PR when you push. This make a terraform init & plan
- [terraform-qa.yml](./.github/workflows/terraform-qa.yml): manually triggered in Github Actions. This make a terraform init, plan, apply & destroy
- [terraform-qa-no-destroy](./.github/workflows/terraform-qa-no-destroy.yml): manually triggered in Github Actions. This make a terraform init, plan & apply
- [terraform-qa-only-destroy](./.github/workflows/terraform-qa-only-destroy.yml): manually triggered in Github Actions. This make a terraform init & destroy
